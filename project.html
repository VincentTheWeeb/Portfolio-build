          <h2>Case Study: Digital Seat Media</h2>
          <p>
            As an intern with Digital Seat Media, one of my first projects was
            to redesign the home page of our platform. It was an exciting
            opportunity for me to contribute to a company that is changing the
            way fans engage with live events. Our mobile web-based platform
            allows fans to interact with their favorite brands and fellow fans,
            all through a simple scan of a QR code-enabled tag located on their
            seat.

          <h3>Functionality</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure that we continue to offer the best possible experience for
            our users, I recently created a redesign of our home page. The
            redesign features a clean design, with improved navigation and
            streamlined access to our platform's key features. The updated
            design also places a stronger emphasis on our partnerships with top
            brands, including Pizza Hut, Cheeze-It's, Braum's, AT&T, In-N-Out
            Burger, Chick-Fil-A, and many more.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges was determining what was important to
            highlight for our investors and future customers. We wanted to
            showcase the strength of our brand partnerships and the ease of use
            of our platform, while also highlighting the benefits of our fan
            engagement technology.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Another challenge I faced was my own inexperience with UI design. I
            spent hours refactoring my code and tweaking the layout of the page,
            trying to find the perfect balance between aesthetics and
            functionality. Looking back, I realize that I probably spent way too
            much time on small details, but it was a valuable learning
            experience for me.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Despite the challenges, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish
            with the redesign of the home page. I was able to create a design
            that effectively communicated our brand message and the benefits of
            our platform, while also creating an engaging and intuitive user
            experience. And, of course, I learned to be a little less precious
            about my code and to prioritize functionality over perfection!
